# Firefox-Classic-Photon
This is a collection of some CSS files for restoring Firefox Photon tab-bar's design.  
Please note that this CSS tweak doesn't remove or add any icons from Photon (except for the playing audio icon).

# Sources
I used the code from other repositories and then just added some small tweaks to polish the design.
